      <p>There are trips that are meticulously planned, and then there are those that come together in the spur of the moment. My recent adventure to Ettina Bhuja falls into the latter category, one of those rare and thrilling experiences that begin with an impulsive decision. It was early morning when my friends and I decided to leave Hassan, and by 9:00 a.m., we were already on the road, riding our bikes towards Sakleshpur. The weather was on our side, with a gentle drizzle adding to the excitement and beauty of the journey.</p><br>

    <p>Upon reaching Sakleshpur, we parked our bikes at a friend's house, picked up another friend, and continued our journey by car. The drive was nothing short of adventurous, with the thrill of the unknown adding to our excitement. At one point, we took a wrong turn and ended up at Bettada Bhairaveshwara, where we were caught in a traffic jam that seemed like it would never end. However, our spirits remained high, and we eventually made our way to our intended destination, Ettina Bhuja.</p>

        </div>

        <p>As we parked our car and began the trek, the sense of adventure only intensified. The weather was perfect, the view breathtaking, and the company of friends made it all the more special. The trek took about an hour and a half, each step bringing us closer to the peak. When we finally reached the top, the view was everything we had hoped for and more. The beauty of the landscape stretched out before us, making every moment of the journey worthwhile.

        <p>By the time we reach the peak the sun shined brightly like never before, the first breeze when it just passed over my face I just felt I was lying on my cozy bed with the air conditioner turned on with the lowest temperature.After clicking some photos and making goofy videos. We started to move from to peak to another just like how gaints would do it. After few hours the sky become cloudy all of a sudden.We could see a white smoke at the bottom of the hill, which started to ascend towards. The moment it hit my Body, It was just like heaven as if I was falling down from the sky between the clouds. At this point of life I forgot everything and made up my mind that this is what I should do for my mental peace. We just sat on the edge of the peak like tomorrow is the end of the world.The shocking thing was after all the time we spent it was just 11 a.m .</p>
        <p>After spending some time soaking in the scenery, we began our descent. On the way back, we stumbled upon a small stall selling Maggi and soft drinks. It was a simple yet satisfying meal, enjoyed in the cool mountain air. As we continued our journey back, there was a brief moment of uncertainty when we felt like we had lost our way, but we soon found our bearings and made it back to our friend's house in Sakleshpur.</p><br>

        <p>After the a group photo with a astonishing background we started to descend. After hydrating ourselves and quick break we started heading towards a small waterfalls which was just a hour drive from Agni Gudda. By the time we reached it was scorching heat before diving into the water we prepared ourselves a good fired rice and some crispy fritters.After a hefty meal, it was time to plunge myself into some cool water. To be frank I do not know how to swim, But I manage by just walking around as I have got strong legs which is easier for me. After chilling out in the water till evening and getting some massage by the nature, it was time to pack up everything and get back to engineering routine</p>
