      <p>There are trips that are meticulously planned, and then there are those that come together in the spur of the moment. My recent adventure to Ettina Bhuja falls into the latter category, one of those rare and thrilling experiences that begin with an impulsive decision. It was early morning when my friends and I decided to leave Hassan, and by 9:00 a.m., we were already on the road, riding our bikes towards Sakleshpur. The weather was on our side, with a gentle drizzle adding to the excitement and beauty of the journey.</p><br>

    <p>Upon reaching Sakleshpur, we parked our bikes at a friend's house, picked up another friend, and continued our journey by car. The drive was nothing short of adventurous, with the thrill of the unknown adding to our excitement. At one point, we took a wrong turn and ended up at Bettada Bhairaveshwara, where we were caught in a traffic jam that seemed like it would never end. However, our spirits remained high, and we eventually made our way to our intended destination, Ettina Bhuja.</p>

        <p>After treking half the hill, we halted for breakfast. We who are in middle of a trek with no resturants or houses ,cooked for ourself a nice lemon rice. It was a lot of fun because no one knew to cook and the best thing was that there was no network, we were only by ourselves totally disconnected with the world, enjoying with no worries like a baby.After our breakfast we started our journey and reached the peak within an hour.
        </p><br>

        <p>By the time we reach the peak the sun shined brightly like never before, the first breeze when it just passed over my face I just felt I was lying on my cozy bed with the air conditioner turned on with the lowest temperature.After clicking some photos and making goofy videos. We started to move from to peak to another just like how gaints would do it. After few hours the sky become cloudy all of a sudden.We could see a white smoke at the bottom of the hill, which started to ascend towards. The moment it hit my Body, It was just like heaven as if I was falling down from the sky between the clouds. At this point of life I forgot everything and made up my mind that this is what I should do for my mental peace. We just sat on the edge of the peak like tomorrow is the end of the world.The shocking thing was after all the time we spent it was just 11 a.m .</p>

        <p>After the a group photo with a astonishing background we started to descend. After hydrating ourselves and quick break we started heading towards a small waterfalls which was just a hour drive from Agni Gudda. By the time we reached it was scorching heat before diving into the water we prepared ourselves a good fired rice and some crispy fritters.After a hefty meal, it was time to plunge myself into some cool water. To be frank I do not know how to swim, But I manage by just walking around as I have got strong legs which is easier for me. After chilling out in the water till evening and getting some massage by the nature, it was time to pack up everything and get back to engineering routine</p>
