      <p>This was my first one day trip with Meriise members. We went on a trek on the next day after Fourth years farewell party. Even though it was with Meriise members it was an unoffical trip. As excepted everyone did not join the trip, even then we started the journey with a good strength.</p><br>

    <p>We started in the morning by 5 a.m from our college. We went with around 20 people ,two cars and three bikes. I who would wake and see the same old busy city every morning, the nature greeted me with a pleasant sunrise and a colorful rainbow . Somehow I feel asleep, by the time I wake up they had stoped for a quick tea break. After having a warm coffee with a chill weather, It made me energetic. After an hour of travelling with some songs, games and mandatory Truth and dare we reached our destination.</p>

        <p>After treking half the hill, we halted for breakfast. We who are in middle of a trek with no resturants or houses ,cooked for ourself a nice lemon rice. It was a lot of fun because no one knew to cook and the best thing was that there was no network, we were only by ourselves totally disconnected with the world, enjoying with no worries like a baby.After our breakfast we started our journey and reached the peak within an hour.
        </p><br>

        <p>By the time we reach the peak the sun shined brightly like never before, the first breeze when it just passed over my face I just felt I was lying on my cozy bed with the air conditioner turned on with the lowest temperature.After clicking some photos and making goofy videos. We started to move from to peak to another just like how gaints would do it. After few hours the sky become cloudy all of a sudden.We could see a white smoke at the bottom of the hill, which started to ascend towards. The moment it hit my Body, It was just like heaven as if I was falling down from the sky between the clouds. At this point of life I forgot everything and made up my mind that this is what I should do for my mental peace. We just sat on the edge of the peak like tomorrow is the end of the world.The shocking thing was after all the time we spent it was just 11 a.m .</p>

        <p>After the a group photo with a astonishing background we started to descend. After hydrating ourselves and quick break we started heading towards a small waterfalls which was just a hour drive from Agni Gudda. By the time we reached it was scorching heat before diving into the water we prepared ourselves a good fired rice and some crispy fritters.After a hefty meal, it was time to plunge myself into some cool water. To be frank I do not know how to swim, But I manage by just walking around as I have got strong legs which is easier for me. After chilling out in the water till evening and getting some massage by the nature, it was time to pack up everything and get back to engineering routine</p>
